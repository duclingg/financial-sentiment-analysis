# Financial Sentiment Analysis

In this program I create a tool that will help predict the price movement of a publicly-traded company's stock, based on the sentiment from news articles mentioning that company, as well as other financial indicators such as stock price.  

By collecting and cleaning news articles, I can then perform the sentiment analysis in regards to the company. And then I can gather important financial data and indicators related to that company.  

After data collection and sentiment analysis, I can build models which determine the correlation between the different data sets, and train a machine learning model to create a tool which will determine the price movement of that stock.

### For easier access viewing and a detailed breakdown of the code: [Jupyter Notebooks](jupyter/notebooks)  

In these notebooks, I am researching and developing the main scope of the tool. I go through the necessary steps in preparing the data for the building and training the model before implementing it in a tool.

## What is Sentiment Analysis?
Also known as opinion mining, it is the process of analyzing large volumes of text to determine its sentiment; which can be positive, negative, or neutral.  

In machine learning, an algorithm is used to train software to gauge sentiment in a block of text, using words that appear in the text as well as the order in which they appear. The goal is to teach software how to identify emotion in text similarly to the way humans do.
